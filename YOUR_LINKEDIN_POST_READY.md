🤖 Can We Trust AI for Financial Advice?

Here's a problem: Ask an AI the same financial question twice, and you might get two different answers.

For example:
Monday: "What's the investment return?" → AI says 15%
Tuesday: "Calculate the return on investment" → AI says 22%

Same question. Different answers. 😬

In finance, this isn't just annoying—it's dangerous:
• Clients lose trust
• Regulators raise red flags
• Banks face legal risks

So I built a solution.

I created a "quality control system" for financial AI that:
✅ Tests if AI gives consistent answers
✅ Scores reliability from 0 (unreliable) to 1 (trustworthy)
✅ Tells banks which questions are safe to automate

The Process:
1️⃣ Asked 50 financial questions
2️⃣ Rephrased each 10 different ways
3️⃣ Got AI to answer 20 times per question
4️⃣ Analyzed 10,000+ responses
5️⃣ Measured consistency

What I Found:
📊 Math calculations: 85% consistent ✅ (safe to automate)
📊 Document analysis: 60% consistent ⚠️ (needs oversight)
📊 Investment advice: 30% consistent ❌ (keep humans involved)

Why This Matters:
Banks can now make informed decisions about where to use AI and where to keep human experts.

Think of it like a safety test for self-driving cars—but for AI that handles your money.

## 💬 SECOND COMMENT (5 Minutes Later)

```
For the technical folks: This uses semantic entropy measurement with HDBSCAN clustering on 10,000+ LLaMA 3 responses.

For everyone else: Think of it as quality control for AI giving financial advice.

Happy to discuss either version! 💬
